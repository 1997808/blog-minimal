There are many motivations behind this. Some use it like a diary, some as a hobby, or as a way to connect to other people, as a way to build an audience, make money and even improve their career opportunities. \r\n\r\nFor some of these content creators, external recognition is not that important. They write what they want, about things they are interested in and they publish whatever they please. The fun is in the writing and the creative process itself.\r\n\r\nOthers like to understand the impact that their efforts have on the world, which posts bring in the readers, what topics people seem to enjoy the most and even how people end up discovering their content in the first place.\r\n\r\n![Website analytics for bloggers and content creators](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/Z2xIkRrq4V2vmeRtcDkeYRozBSJmaHRzuxRI \"Website analytics for bloggers and content creators\")\r\n\r\n## Web analytics give you a strong signal\r\n\r\nThis helps motivate them to put even more effort, publish more of the content that people enjoy the most and create a better website experience in general.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where website analytics come into the picture. Web analytics give website owners and bloggers a strong signal on what they have achieved, what worked well and what not so well. This helps them improve and better organize their future efforts. \r\n\r\nGoogle Analytics is the obvious and the default choice for most websites. Even though it is a very useful and powerful tool used on the majority of websites on the web, it [brings several issues](https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics) that distract site owners from what they enjoy doing the most. \r\n\r\nHere's a look at why we created Plausible Analytics as a great [Google Analytics alternative](https://plausible.io/vs-google-analytics) for content creators and their personal websites and blogs.\r\n\r\n## Google Analytics is complicated to use and understand\r\n\r\nGoogle Analytics collects so much data from website visitors that it can showcase more than 125 different reports and almost 300 individual metrics. You as a site owner will rarely have a need for more than a handful of these. This makes Google Analytics an overkill for the majority of bloggers.\r\n\r\nMany try to simplify Google Analytics by creating custom reports and custom dashboards. Some even take Google Analytics training courses in order to learn how to use it, how to understand the different metrics and extract actionable insights from them.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to publish content and interact with people, learning about analytics is not something you put on top of your priority list. So you end up ignoring Google Analytics. You keep it installed on your site and it keeps tracking your visitors but you don't really get much value from it.\r\n\r\nPlausible Analytics is built with [simplicity in mind](https://plausible.io/simple-web-analytics). Anyone can understand all the metrics we present at a glance and without having any training or prior analytics experience. Everything you need to know is on one page.\r\n\r\nYou can get an overview of all the most actionable metrics in one minute and get on with tasks that you enjoy more such as creating new content or engaging with your audience.\r\n\r\n## Google Analytics requires a privacy policy, cookie prompt and user consent\r\n\r\nThere are several requirements for using Google Analytics. Some from Google's side and others from the different privacy regulations.\r\n\r\nGoogle for instance [requires](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/) you to have a privacy policy with details on your usage of Google Analytics. \r\n\r\n> “You must post a Privacy Policy and that Privacy Policy must provide notice of Your use of cookies, identifiers for mobile devices or similar technology used to collect data. You must disclose the use of Google Analytics, and how it collects and processes data. You will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that a User is provided with clear and comprehensive information about, and consents to, the storing and accessing of cookies or other information on the User’s device where such activity occurs in connection with the Service and where providing such information and obtaining such consent is required by law.”\r\n\r\nOn top of this, Google Analytics places [multiple cookies](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage) on the machines of your visitors which means that you need to ask for cookie consent from your visitors too.\r\n\r\nThese are things that many site owners and bloggers simply don't want to nor have the time or capacity to deal with. And the value that Google Analytics provides may not be worth it in terms of what it takes to have it running with regards to dealing with privacy policy and cookie consent.\r\n\r\nPlausible Analytics is compatible with the different privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA and PECR out of the box. [We don't use cookies](https://plausible.io/data-policy) and we don't collect any personal data from your visitors either. This means that you don't need to have a privacy policy regarding Plausible Analytics and you don't need to have a cookie banner nor ask to get consent from your visitors.\r\n\r\nYou keep your site simple, clean and optimized for your visitors. No need to put any time and effort into legal aspects. You can focus on the more creative side of things.\r\n\r\n## Google Analytics slows down your site and worsens the visitor experience\r\n\r\nGoogle Analytics is a bloated script that collects a lot of unnecessary data and it's not useful for the majority of site owners. This can lead to your site having slower loading times. It is common that the different speed tests including Google's own PageSpeed Insights flag Google Analytics as one of the elements that slow down a site.\r\n\r\nThe recommended way to start tracking your website using Google Analytics is to install the Global Site Tag (gtag.js) tracking code on all of your pages. It weighs 28 KB and it downloads another file called the Google Analytics tag which adds an additional 17.7 KB to your page size. These two tracking scripts combined add 45.7 KB of page weight to each and every page load.\r\n\r\nEvery KB can make a difference if you want to optimize for speed. Plausible Analytics script [weighs less than 1 KB](https://plausible.io/lightweight-web-analytics). That’s more than 45 times smaller than the Google Analytics Global Site Tag. Your site will keep loading fast and your visitors will have a smooth experience. \r\n\r\n## Google Analytics is blocked by many web users\r\n\r\nGoogle Analytics is the most widely used tracking script on the web. This makes it a big target. Browsers such as Brave and Firefox block it, so do the different ad-blocking extensions such as the uBlock Origin. \r\n\r\nThese are used by millions of web users who won't be counted in your website statistics. It's not uncommon to see 40% or even more of the audience on a tech website blocking Google Analytics.\r\n\r\nPlausible Analytics is a new player on this market and it's privacy-friendly by default, so it doesn't see the same level of blockage. We also have a proxy that allows you to run our script as a [first party connection from your domain name](https://plausible.io/docs/proxy/introduction). You may very well see more accurate (and higher) visitor numbers.\r\n","slug":"post-1"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Umami - The Better Google Analytics Alternative","description":"Find out why Umami is the best GA alternative.","date":"2024-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/posts/02.jpg","categories":["development"],"authors":["John Doe"],"tags":["diy","toy"],"draft":false},"content":"\r\nBoth businesses and personal users need to understand their website data to gain insights into how their customers, users, and visitors engage with their content. Google Analytics provides these insights into website traffic, but its practices raise concerns about user privacy and data protection. Like most Google products, Google Analytics is free because Google collects all sorts of data and then uses it to make money in its other products, like Google Ads.\r\n\r\nThis blog post explores how Google Analytics works, the privacy implications regarding the data it collects and how it uses it, and why Umami is a suitable privacy-first alternative.\r\n\r\n# How Google Analytics Works\r\n\r\nTo use Google Analytics, website owners have to first create an account and then add a tracking code to their website. The tracking code collects user behavior data, including the user's IP address, device, browser, and location. Google Analytics uses cookie-based tracking to monitor users across different sessions and to identify unique users.\r\nWhat Data Does Google Analytics Collect?\r\nGoogle Analytics collects various data about a user's behavior on a website. Such as:\r\n\r\n1. **User location**: Google Analytics can track a user's location based on their IP address. This allows website owners to see where their visitors are coming from and can help them tailor their content to specific regions.\r\n2. **Device type**: Google Analytics can track the user's device (i.e., desktop, iPhone, tablet, etc). This includes information about the user's operating system, browser, and screen size.\r\n3. **User behavior**: Google Analytics tracks what users do on a website, such as page visits, time on site, and actions they perform (such as filling out a form, clicking a button, etc.). With specific settings enabled, Google Analytics can also track things like scroll depth.\r\n4. **Referral source**: Google Analytics can track how users find the website, whether through a search engine, social media, clicking a link in an email, a paid advertisement, or another website.\r\n5. **Demographic information**: Google Analytics can provide demographic information about users, such as age, gender, and interests.\r\n\r\nGoogle can also source and combine data from other Google services like Search and YouTube and share it back to Google Analytics. Google states in Data Share Settings sections of the Google Analytics docs that, “Google products & services: When you turn this setting ON, Google can access and analyze data to better understand online behavior and trends, and use this data to improve Google products and services.”\r\n\r\n# How Does Google Analytics Use This Data?\r\n\r\nGoogle Analytics uses the data it collects on website visitors and creates profiles for them, which advertising can use as targeting criteria in their Google Ads campaigns. For example, if a user is identified as being interested in a particular topic (such as networking software), they may be shown ads related to that topic.\r\n\r\nGoogle can bucket users into two categories: Affinity or In-Market. Affinity means the user is generally interested in a topic, and In-Market suggests the user is in the market to make a purchase. Google aggregates your actions online - not just from your website activity on Google Analytics - to create a profile for you. If a user visits a website about a new Honda, gets directions to the Honda dealership in Google Maps, visits websites about auto financing, and watches YouTube videos about Honda reviews, Google will bucket you as someone in the market to purchase a new car.\r\n\r\nAlthough this type of advertising can work because it is based on the user's interests and behavior, it can feel unsavory that Google is tracking everything you're doing and bucketing you into categories. How would you feel if I stood over your shoulder watching and writing down everything you did, everywhere you went, and then used that information to sell something to you? We probably wouldn't be friends.\r\n\r\nThere are concerns about this data regarding user privacy, such as:\r\n\r\n- Users might not know this data is being tracked\r\n- Users should be informed that this data is being collected\r\n- Users should have to give their consent for their data to be used in this way\r\n\r\nAnother concern is that the data collected by Google is only sometimes correct, which can lead to false assumptions about users' behavior.\r\n\r\n# Privacy Implications of Using Google Analytics\r\n\r\nUsing Google Analytics raises questions about user consent and control over their personal information. Many users likely don't know the extent of the data collection and the implications of allowing Google Analytics to track their online activity. This lack of transparency and control over personal data goes against privacy and data protection principles.\r\n\r\nThe potential for data breaches on the information collected by Google Analytics is a concern. Users entrust their browsing behavior and personal details to website owners, who are responsible for safeguarding this data. However, reliance on third-party services like Google Analytics introduces additional security risks that may compromise user privacy.\r\n\r\n# What Can Website Owners Do to Protect User Privacy?\r\n\r\nWebsite owners should prioritize transparency and user consent when implementing tracking tools like Google Analytics. Respecting user privacy and providing clear information about what data is being collected can help build trust and foster a more ethical approach to website analytics.\r\n\r\nOne way to do this is to provide users with a clear and prominent privacy policy that explains what data is collected, why it is collected, and how it is used. Website owners should also give users the option to opt out of data collection if they choose to do so. This typically comes in the form of cookie opt-in/opt-out banners, where users need to click a button to be tracked.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to use an alternative analytics tool that prioritizes user privacy. Privacy-focused website analytics tools, such as Umami, are now commonly available. Umami offers [similar features](/features) to Google Analytics but with a significantly greater focus on user privacy. Umami is a cookie-free website analytics platform that does not require those annoying opt-in cookie banners.\r\n\r\nUmami has two versions: self-hosted and cloud. Both versions allow full data ownership since users can export all their data from Umami anytime. This can provide added security and peace of mind for businesses concerned about data privacy. On the other hand, Google Analytics stores data on Google's servers, which some companies may be uncomfortable with.\r\n\r\nThere are concerns with Google Analytics regarding user privacy and data protection. Website owners should prioritize transparency and user consent when implementing tracking tools like Google Analytics. Respecting user privacy and providing clear information about what data is being collected and how it is being used can help build trust and foster a more ethical approach to website analytics.\r\n\r\nTry [Umami](https://cloud.umami.is/signup?ref=umami-blog) today, which makes it easy to collect, analyze, and understand your web data while maintaining visitor privacy and data ownership.","slug":"post-2"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"What you need to know about Photography","description":"meta description","date":"2022-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/posts/03.jpg","categories":["art"],"authors":["bannedit's musings"],"tags":["diy","toy"],"draft":false},"content":"\r\nPosted on Tue 20 August 2019 in [Research](https://bannedit.github.io/category/research.html)\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\r\nVirtual Machine (VM) detection is nothing new. Malware has been doing it for over a decade now. Over time the techniques have advanced as defenders learned new ways of avoiding VM detection.\r\n\r\nA while back a friend and I were working on a project related to exploit delivery via a web application for redteaming purposes. I wanted a way to fingerprint visitors of the site and hash the fingerprint data so I could look for potential repeat visitors. While investigating fingerprinting I stumbled upon something pretty interesting. I was looking at some code that collected information about WebGL capabilities. I quickly realized that some of the fingerprinting information could be useful for VM detection because vendor names were exposed. In this particular instance the string \"VMWare\" was contained within the WebGL information. After some more testing I also discovered that VirtualBox reported the same kind of information.\r\n\r\nOnce I realized it was potentially possible to detect VMs from the browser I started to dig deeper and began searching for other research related to this discovery. I found a pretty well researched academic paper [\\[1\\]](http://yinzhicao.org/TrackingFree/crossbrowsertracking_NDSS17.pdf) related to tracking users across multiple browsers. This gave me some other potential techniques that could be applied to VM detection.\r\n\r\nThe end goal of this research is to have multiple techniques for VM detection. Multiple techniques lead to much more accurate detection. Since some techniques are more false-positive prone than others, a weighting system can be applied to the detection capabilities. This allows us to generate detection confidence scoring. This can help account for inaccuracies of certain detection methods. Given enough testing and data it would then be possible to come up with a reasonable threshold value. If a browser scores above the threshold then it would most likely be within a VM. Alternatively, if the browser scored below the threshold value it could be considered to be running on physical hardware.\r\n\r\n### Techniques\r\n\r\nNow that I have covered some of the background information and history leading up to this blog post we can start to dig into the actual techniques.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned prior in the introduction, WebGL can provide a lot of information about the OpenGL implementation including vendor information. The WEBGL\\_debug\\_renderer\\_info extension [\\[2\\]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WEBGL_debug_renderer_info) can be used to query for debug information such as the WebGL vendor and rendered.\r\n\r\nvar canvas \\= document.createElement('canvas');\r\nvar gl \\= canvas.getContext('webgl');\r\n\r\nvar debugInfo \\= gl.getExtension('WEBGL\\_debug\\_renderer\\_info');\r\nvar vendor \\= gl.getParameter(debugInfo.UNMASKED\\_VENDOR\\_WEBGL);\r\nvar renderer \\= gl.getParameter(debugInfo.UNMASKED\\_RENDERER\\_WEBGL);\r\n\r\nconsole.log(vendor);\r\nconsole.log(renderer);\r\n\r\nAdditionally, extension availability can be queried using the **_getExtension_** method on a WebGL context. I have not fully explored this avenue but it might be possible to detect certain WebGL implementations provided by VMs based on the extensions available. Though this idea is likely very false-positive prone.\r\n\r\nBelow is a screenshot from [\\[3\\]](https://webglreport.com) WebGLReport a website dedicated to fingerprinting WebGL.\r\n\r\n> ![alt-text](resources/VirtualBox-VM-Win10-Chrome.png \"VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Visiting webglreport.com\") **_VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Visiting webglreport.com_**\r\n\r\nNow, it is important to note that this depends on how the VM is configured. In Virtual Box for example, setting the graphics controller setting under Display to VMSVGA will report cause WebGL to use CPU based implementations of OpenGL which is browser dependent. However, this could still be a useful indicator that the client machine is running in a VM because most modern hardware has integrated GPUs and can provide access to OpenGL natively. Just keep in mind that CPU based OpenGL implementations do not necessarily mean it is a VM outright.\r\n\r\n> ![alt-text](resources/VirtualBox-VM-Win10-Chrome-VMSVGA.png \"VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Using VMSVGA\") **_VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Using VMSVGA Visiting webglreport.com_**\r\n\r\nThis screenshot depicts Google Chrome utilizing the CPU based OpenGL implementation renderer Google SwiftShader [\\[4\\]](https://github.com/google/swiftshader).\r\n\r\nAnother technique seen in normal malware is to determine the screen width and height. This can be achieved in Javascript as well. Additionally, color depth and bits per pixel are other potentially good indicators related to the display.\r\n\r\nvar width \\= screen.width;\r\nvar height \\= screen.height;\r\nvar color\\_depth \\= screen.colorDepth;\r\nvar bitspp \\= screen.pixelDepth;\r\n\r\nMore details on the screen object can be found at [\\[5\\]](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_screen.asp).\r\n\r\nCan we detect the amount of RAM on the client? You bet. Again using Javascript we can determine roughly the amount of RAM available on the browser. One quirk to note here is that the browser will only report RAM values in gigabytes (gb). It also has a quirk where it will only report up to 8gb and as low as 256mb (0.25gb). These ranges of values however, are still enough to use as a VM detection method. Most physical workstations these days come with at least 8gb of RAM. Detecting smaller amounts of RAM such as 2gb or less would be a good indicator the client browser is in a VM. The specification for the Device Memory can be found at [\\[6\\]](https://www.w3.org/TR/device-memory/)\r\n\r\nvar ram \\= navigator.deviceMemory;\r\n\r\nFinally, the last technique I will be covering detects the number of CPU cores. This is done by performing timing attacks using multiple web workers running simultaneously. During my testing of this technique I found it to be very accurate. I tested this concept out using the [\\[7\\]](https://oswg.oftn.org/projects/core-estimator/demo/) Core Estimator Demo site. A small number of CPU cores can be a decent VM indicator and has been used by malware in the past. Core Estimator also provides the Javascript libraries on github [\\[8\\]](https://github.com/oftn-oswg/core-estimator).\r\n\r\n> ![alt-text](resources/VirtualBox-VM-Win10-Chrome-2-Cores.png \"VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Chrome With 2 CPU Cores\") **_VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome 2 CPU Cores Tested with Core Estimator_**\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis blog post covered four unique VM detection capabilities that can be performed from Javascript. When I first discovered these techniques my initial thought was to apply the concepts toward VM detection. Hopefully, both defenders and offensive security professions can find something useful to apply these techniques toward.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to see that academics and various other researchers have applied some of the same concepts toward fingerprinting and privacy issues.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n1.
